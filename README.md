2D mouse game Sokoban

A 2D game project with the aim of using the knowledge gained in the POO course,using a scanner to read text files which in turn creates the corresponding levels
The objective of the game is to push crates to the existing targets in the level in order to move to the next level without losing all energy in the vehicle.

To create a custom level the text file has to have:
1ºline - energy level(int)

2ºline - number of lines on the board

3ºline - number of Columns on the board

next lines - display of the game objects (# = wall ,E = Vehicle, P = Battery Recharge, V = Battery Drain, B = Hole, C = Crate, X = Target , ' '(space) = Floor)

The following example show how it works:
